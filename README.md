This is a predictive model for rice yield in Vietnam using real time satellite data from Microsoft Planetary Hub. The data were derived from satelites such as Sentinel 1, 2 and Landsat 8-9 missions and were accessible through Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform.This predictive model is selected as the Level 2 Global Winner of the 2023 EY Open Science Data Challenge, with ranking 1st in Canada and the world out of 13000+ competitors, 630 universities and 110 countries. The model utilises ensembling of machine learning models with hyper parameterized parameters for each individual model getting an overall evaluation score of 0.66 in the EY leaderboards.
